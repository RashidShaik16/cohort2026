# Cohort 2026 – Full Stack Development Journey

This repository documents my **6–8 month full-stack software development journey** as part of the **ChaiCode Cohort 2026** mentorship program.

The goal of this repository is to **track learning progress, assignments, blogs, and projects** in a structured and transparent way from fundamentals to production grade applications.
